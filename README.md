# salishsea-io
Salish Sea Data Explorer

Welcome! This is a new project, started in 2025, to gather sightings and information about whales in the Salish Sea. There is a ton of useful and interesting information about this ecosystem that would reach a greater audience if it were all in one place and cross-referenced. Over time, we hope the site can develop into a place for the people who live in the region to come connect, deepen their understanding of the ecology, and fight to protect it.

This codebase was started by Peter Abrahamsen. My goals for the codebase are to keep it relatively light, nimble, and maintainable, minimizing the number of abstractions or volatile third-party dependencies. Right now, I'm using:
- [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for better refactoring and quality control than vanilla JS
- [sqlite](https://www.sqlite.org/) for storing and projecting data
- [better-sqlite](https://github.com/WiseLibs/better-sqlite3/) for accessing sqlite from JS
- [vite](https://vite.dev/) for building out assets
- [express](https://expressjs.com/) for serving assets and the API
- [lit](https://lit.dev/) for templating and scoped styles
- [openlayers](https://openlayers.org/) for drawing and interacting with a map in the browser
- [temporal-polyfill](https://www.npmjs.com/package/temporal-polyfill) for early access to the sane date/time manipulation interface [Temporal](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Temporal)
- [turf](https://turfjs.org/) for a few GIS utility functions

They are (mostly) simple, fast, well-understood, long-lived, and easily-replaced projects appropriate to take as dependencies.

Most project planning currently happens on Zulip. You are welcome to join us there: https://orcasound.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/494032-salishsea-io

## Setup

Prerequisites:
- `nvm` (or install the version of node from `.nvmrc` yourself)
- `sqlite` (only needed for command line use)

Suggested: for better output from sqlite, make a file `~/.sqliterc` with these lines:
```
.headers on
.mode column
```

Prep the environment:
```
$ nvm install
$ nvm use
$ npm install
$ wget https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/inaturalist-taxonomy.dwca.zip
$ unzip inaturalist-taxonomy.dwca.zip taxa.csv VernacularNames-english.csv
$ sqlite3 salish-sea.sqlite3 < setup.sql
```

Get an access code for the Washington State Ferries API [here](https://www.wsdot.wa.gov/traffic/api/). Put it in a file called `.env` like so:
```
WSF_ACCESS_CODE=my-access-code
```

## Running

For development mode, run `node run dev`.

## Data sources

- [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/) observations and taxonomy
- [Conserve](https://conserve.io) aggregates sightings from various places, including Orca Network's [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/564701038927716)
- ESRI provides a nice but unmaintained base map with coarse ocean depth
- Viewing locations are defined by [Orca Network](https://www.orcanetwork.org/)

## Data

The scope of data is meant to match those of [Acartia](https://github.com/salish-sea/acartia/wiki/1.-Context-for-SSEMMI-&-Acartia#spatial-boundaries-related-to-acartia), which is meant to capture the full range of Southern Resident Killer Whales.

Geographic coordinates are decimal longitudes and latitudes with respect to WGS84. The projection is [EPSG:3857](https://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/3857/) (Pseudo-Merctaor). Switching to [EPSG:32610](https://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/32610/) (UTM 10N) might be nicer, but would require custom raster maps.

Temporal coordinates are UNIX Epoch timeâ€”integer seconds since midnight, January 1, 1970, GMT. This format is widely supported, and allows for cheap calculation of intervals in SQL queries.

## Production deployment

For now, the instance of the application at https://salishsea.io/ is hosted on a virtual server I (Peter) run.
